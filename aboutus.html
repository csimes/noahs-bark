<p class="aboutus">Inspired by the COVID pandemic, Noah's Bark started out as a group of friends wanting to relieve strained pet owners by providing a place for their beloved companions to stay. In just a few short months, due to generous donations, grants, and a lot of hard work - we were able to grow into a place of refuge for many. We pride ourselves on a sense of community and do our best to make both residents and visitors feel like family. <br><br>
Our desire is to advocate on behalf of all animals in need, while strengthening the bond between humans and animals. We do this through education, providing resources, and creating programs that foster understanding and compassion. We aim to bring an end to the killing of orphaned and abandoned shelter animals and create a safe space for them to flourish and thrive, whether it be with us, or through our companion matching services.
